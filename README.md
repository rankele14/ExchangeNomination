## Environmental Variables/Files

Google OAuth2 support requires two keys to function as intended: Client ID and Client Secret

Create a new file called application.yml in the /config folder and add the following lines:

  `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID_HERE'`

  `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE'`


## Deployment

Setup a Heroku account: https://signup.heroku.com/

From the heroku dashboard select `New` -> `Create New Pipline`

Name the pipeline, and link the respective git repo to the pipline

Our application does not need any extra options, so select `Enable Review Apps` right away

Click `New app` under review apps, and link your test branch from your repo

Under staging app, select `Create new app` and link your main branch from your repo

--------

To add enviornment variables to enable google oauth2 functionality, head over to the settings tab on the pipeline dashboard

Scroll down until `Reveal config vars`

Add both your client id and your secret id, with fields `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` respectively

Now once your pipeline has built the apps, select `Open app` to open the app

With the staging app, if you would like to move the app to production, click the two up and down arrows and select `Move to production`

And now your application is setup and in production mode!
